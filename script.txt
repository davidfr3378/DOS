/ This is script one. 
/ Made to test the Math DSL I programmed (I have to say, I didn't do a lot of logic and error checking).
Take this scenario: a machine needs to perform a series of simple arithmetic computations for an unknown reason, and thus it plugs the input into the program via this file.
/ Calculate and store the natural log of the sine of 90 (should be ln(1) = 0)
let a cp 90 sin log
/ Compute absolute value of -45 (to test abs), store in b
let b cp -45 abs
/ Calculate log base 10 of 1000 (should be 3), store in c
let c cp 1000 log
/ Combine a, b, and c using addition and multiplication
// ((a + b) * c)
let d cp a b + c *
/ Now test exponentiation: e = (2^4)
let e cp 2 4 ^
/ Store cosine of 60 into f
let f cp 60 cos
/ Store tangent of 45 into g
let g cp 45 tan
/ Combine d, e, f, g: h = d + e - f * g
let h cp f g * e - d +
/ Check value of h
var h
/ Clear some variables
clear a
clear c
clear f
